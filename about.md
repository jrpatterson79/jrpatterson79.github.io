    I am currently an NSF postdocotoral fellow at Rice University working with an environmental geophysics group in the Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences Department. I consider myself a physical hydrogeologist with a research focus on characterizing the heterogeneous subsurface structures that controls flow and transport through the subsurface. This allows me to develop predictive models that improve environmental decision making.</p>
