    I am an NSF postdocotoral fellow at Rice University working with an <a href="https://earthscience.rice.edu/ajo-franklin-lab/">environmental geophysics group</a> in the Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences Department. Water is a thread that weaves it's way through the entirety of my life, from fishing small mountain streams as a kid to whitewater rafting and kayaking as an adult. I was first exposed to groundwater during a deployment with the U.S. Army. My deployment experience combined with an innate curiosity, and a strong motivation to conserve the natural environment inspired me to pursue degrees in geoscience with a focus on hydrogeology. Outside of work I spend my time playing guitar, running, reading, cooking, and eating.</p>
